# Code Generation Prompt

This file provides guidance for code generation based on the comprehensive documentation in the `/docs` folder.

## Core Principle: Documentation-First Implementation

All code generation MUST strictly adhere to the specifications defined in the documentation files. No implementation should deviate from the documented requirements without explicit justification and documentation updates.

## Required Documentation Review Before Code Generation

Before generating any code, MUST review these files in order:

1. **CLAUDE.md** - Project instructions and overrides (HIGHEST PRIORITY)
2. **PRODUCT_REQUIREMENTS.md** - Core functionality and business logic
3. **UI_UX_DESIGN.md** - Visual design, layout, and user interaction patterns
4. **TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md** - Implementation details, interfaces, and architecture
5. **SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md** - High-level system design and component relationships
6. **USER_STORIES.md** - User workflows and acceptance criteria
7. **TESTING_STRATEGY.md** - Quality requirements and testing approach

## Code Generation Guidelines

### Frontend Implementation
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript (versions from CLAUDE.md and package.json)
- **Build Tool**: Vite with Docker container development environment
- **State Management**: Redux Toolkit with documented slice structure
- **Styling**: Styled-components with theme from TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md
- **UI Components**: Must match wireframe specifications in UI_UX_DESIGN.md
- **Data Models**: Use TypeScript interfaces from TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md
- **Project Structure**: Follow CLAUDE.md project organization
- **Development**: Docker Compose with Docker Watch for live reloading

### Backend Implementation  
- **Framework**: Go with Gin router (as specified in TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md)
- **Development**: Docker container with Air live reload
- **API Design**: RESTful endpoints with standardized response format
- **Database**: PostgreSQL with schema from TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md
- **Cache**: Redis for session storage and WebSocket state
- **Authentication**: JWT-based system as documented
- **Environment**: Docker Compose orchestration with database and cache services

### Key Implementation Requirements

#### Dual Modal System (Critical)
- Left modal: QR code display, class joining functionality
- Right modal: Student management, point tracking
- Independent operation as specified in UI_UX_DESIGN.md

#### Student Management Features
- Real-time updates when students join via QR
- Point system with color-coded badges (red negative, green positive)
- 5-student group formation excluding guests
- Blue cards for active students, gray for guests

#### Data Flow Requirements
- Redux store structure from TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md
- API endpoints exactly as documented
- WebSocket integration for real-time updates

## Mandatory Checks Before Code Generation

1. **Wireframe Alignment**: Does the code match WIRE_FRAME.png specifications?
2. **Technical Consistency**: Are TypeScript interfaces and API contracts followed?
3. **UI/UX Compliance**: Do colors, layout, and interactions match design specs?
4. **Architecture Adherence**: Is the component structure as documented?
5. **Testing Coverage**: Can the code be tested per TESTING_STRATEGY.md?

## Code Quality Standards

- **TypeScript**: Strict typing, no `any` types
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error states and user feedback
- **Performance**: Optimized renders, proper memoization
- **Accessibility**: ARIA labels, keyboard navigation support
- **Testing**: Unit and integration test compatibility

## Documentation Update Requirements

If code generation requires deviation from documented specifications:

1. **Document the change** in relevant .md files
2. **Justify the deviation** with technical reasoning  
3. **Update dependent documentation** to maintain consistency
4. **Follow change review process** from code_review_prompt.md

### Version Change Protocol

When making code changes or version updates:

1. **Review CLAUDE.md** for current version specifications
2. **Update package.json** with new dependency versions
3. **Check documentation alignment**:
   - SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md for major framework versions (React, Redux Toolkit)
   - TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md for significant API or interface changes
   - DEVELOPMENT_SPRINT_PLANNING.md for technology stack references
4. **Update only necessary version references** in documentation:
   - Major framework versions (React 19.x â†’ 20.x)
   - Breaking API changes requiring documentation updates
   - Significant capability additions that affect architecture
5. **Avoid documenting patch/minor versions** unless they introduce breaking changes
6. **Single source of truth**: CLAUDE.md and package.json hold authoritative version information

### Development Workflow

All code generation should support the Docker Compose development environment:

- **Local Development**: Use `docker-compose up --watch` for full-stack development
- **Frontend**: Vite HMR in container with volume-mounted source code
- **Backend**: Go Air live reload in container with database and Redis
- **Database**: PostgreSQL container with persistent storage and migrations
- **Testing**: All services available for integration testing in containers

## Sprint Timeline Alignment

Code generation should align with the 4-day sprint plan (June 20-23, 2025):

- **Day 1**: Docker setup, frontend container, left modal, API mocking
- **Day 2**: Backend container, right modal UI, database integration
- **Day 3**: Backend APIs, frontend-backend integration, WebSocket setup
- **Day 4**: Testing, polish, production Docker builds

## Implementation Priorities

1. **Core Functionality**: QR joining, student management, point tracking
2. **UI Fidelity**: Exact wireframe implementation
3. **Real-time Features**: Live updates, WebSocket integration
4. **Error Handling**: Comprehensive user feedback
5. **Performance**: Optimal loading and rendering
6. **Testing**: Full coverage per testing strategy

## Code Generation Output Format

Generated code should include:
- **File headers** with purpose and documentation references
- **TypeScript interfaces** matching TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md
- **Component documentation** explaining wireframe alignment
- **Error handling** with user-friendly messages
- **Test setup** compatible with testing strategy

## Validation Checklist

Before finalizing any generated code:

- [ ] Matches documented TypeScript interfaces
- [ ] Implements wireframe design exactly
- [ ] Follows Redux store structure
- [ ] Uses documented API endpoints
- [ ] Includes proper error handling
- [ ] Supports documented user workflows
- [ ] Maintains performance requirements
- [ ] Enables comprehensive testing

This prompt ensures all generated code maintains strict alignment with the comprehensive documentation foundation established for the ClassSwift Teacher Dashboard project.
