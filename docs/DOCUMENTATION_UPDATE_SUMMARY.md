## New Features Documented

### QR Code Redirect Flow
1. QR code contains application URL (not direct ClassSwift ViewSonic URL)
2. Application redirects students to `https://www.classswift.viewsonic.io/`
3. Students complete authentication on external platform
4. Students redirected back with session tokens

### Scoring System (0-100)
- Single score value instead of positive/negative points
- Non-negative integers only (0-100 range)
- Scores reset to 0 when student panel opens
- Blue badges for active students, gray for guests

### Text Truncation Rules
- Class ID: Full available width with ellipsis if needed
- Classroom name: Maximum 50% of modal width with ellipsis
- Student names: Truncated with ellipsis in available space

### Modal Independence
- Left modal X button closes only left modal
- Right modal X button closes only right modal
- No navigation changes when closing modals
- Background shows blank state or Class List when no modals open

### UI-Only Features
- Three-dot menu shows "Reset Scores" and "Fresh Session" options
- Actions are display-only and non-functional in current phase
- Maintains UI consistency for future implementation

## Technical Implementation Notes

### API Changes Required
- Update `/api/v1/classes/:id/qr` endpoint to include `redirectUrl`
- Update `/api/v1/classes/:id/join` to redirect to ClassSwift ViewSonic
- Update WebSocket message types for score events
- Add score validation (0-100 range)

### Frontend Changes Required
- Replace point management with score management
- Implement text truncation with CSS ellipsis
- Update modal closing behavior
- Add score reset functionality on panel open
- Update UI state management for independent modals

### Data Model Changes
- Replace `negativePoints`/`positivePoints` with single `score` field
- Add `redirectUrl` configuration
- Update validation constraints for scoring system
- Add score reset tracking in application state

## Consistency Verification
All documentation files now consistently reflect:
- QR code redirect flow instead of direct links
- 0-100 scoring system instead of point system
- Independent modal closing behavior
- Text truncation specifications
- UI-only menu actions
- Maximum 30 student capacity
- Score reset on panel open

This ensures alignment across product requirements, technical design, UI/UX specifications, and user stories.
