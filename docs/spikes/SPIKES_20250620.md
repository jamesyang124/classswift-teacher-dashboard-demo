# SPIKE: Clarify Classroom Dual-Modal Flow
**Owner:** James Yang  
**Time-box:** 2 days (2025-06-21 – 2025-06-22)  
**Status:** Draft  

---

## 1 Background  
The new classroom page uses two stacked modals (right = roster, left = QR / share).  
After reviewing the latest wireframe, several behaviours remain unclear and block estimation.

## 2 Goals / Definition of Done  
* Every question below has a clear answer or decision.  
* A concise Design Spec (or ready-to-implement tickets) is produced.  
* Prototype only if needed to validate navigation or overflow rules.

### 3-1 Left Modal — Issues to Clarify  
*(each number matches its screenshot)*  
1. **Which page should the “Back to Class List” button navigate to?** We may need an additional user story to clarify the overall user-journey sequence.  
2. **What exact URL will be copied?** Is it identical to the URL encoded in the QR code?  
3. **What is the expected ID format and length limit?** If the text exceeds the available width, how should it be handled (wrap, truncate, etc.)?  
4. **Where does the “Version” value come from—client/server build, QR-code generator, or a hard-coded string?** Please specify.  
5. When the user clicks **“Close”** in the left panel, **which layout should appear next?** (Currently we assume it returns to the right-side modal.)

#### Other considerations for the Left Modal  
- Because the QR code is meant for external devices to scan, having a “Copy Link” button for the current device on the same page may confuse users.  
  - Should we move Copy Link elsewhere (e.g., add a *Classroom Info* tab on the right modal) or remove it entirely?  
- **Having both Back and Close buttons can confuse users by providing multiple exit paths.**  
  - **Could we keep only “Back to Class List”?** If both buttons must remain, please specify the destination layout for each.  
  - With a single-exit strategy, the _right modal_ becomes the sole entry point; users tap the _menu icon_ there to open the _left modal_ whenever they need to scan the QR code.

### 3-2 Right Modal — Issues to Clarify  
*(each number matches its screenshot)*  
1. After the user clicks **“Close,”** which URL or base panel should be displayed?  
2. The **classroom name** may be too long. Please specify the length limit and overflow behaviour.  
   - If there are no active students, should the display show an empty string or **“0/30”** by default?  
   - What is the **maximum class size**? If large, do we need lazy loading or just render the full list with a scrollbar?  
   - Guest slots are greyed out and non-interactive. Under which scenario does this occur?  
3. **Does the number in each cell represent a grid index, enrollment ID, seat ID, or the classroom-join order?**  
4. The counter may hold any non-negative value; what does it represent for the teacher? Should it reset each time the panel is reopened or persist under certain rules?  
5. Student names vary in length. What is the length limit and overflow style (e.g., truncate to **“Daneilen…”**)?  
6. Are there specific UI or functional requirements for the ellipsis (…) menu? Should it open another modal, or can we begin with a draft wireframe?
