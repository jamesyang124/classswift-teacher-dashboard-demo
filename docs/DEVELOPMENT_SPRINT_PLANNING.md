- ✅ Migrated from single-class to multi-class Redux store architecture (`classesSlice`)
- ✅ Implemented sophisticated seat assignment logic with preferred seat handling
- ✅ Added cross-class student exclusivity (students cannot be in multiple classes)
- ✅ Created intelligent initialization behavior (first-open vs re-open modal states)
- ✅ Removed API dependencies for seat operations (fully client-side)

**Advanced Seat Assignment Logic:**
- ✅ Preferred seat assignment with fallback to ASC order for enrolled students
- ✅ Guest user support with automatic "Guest" display (no student ID required)
- ✅ Real-time available slot calculation from seat map data
- ✅ Full capacity handling with graceful degradation
- ✅ Cross-class student movement with automatic seat cleanup

**Testing Infrastructure:**
- ✅ Implemented Vitest for modern frontend testing (21 comprehensive test cases)

- ✅ Created comprehensive test coverage for all seat assignment scenarios
- ✅ Fixed backend unit tests after architecture changes
- ✅ Integrated test commands into Makefile for easy execution

**WebSocket Integration Enhancements:**

- ✅ Implemented cross-class student movement detection and cleanup
- ✅ Added guest vs enrolled student differentiation in websocket handling

**Documentation & Architecture:**
