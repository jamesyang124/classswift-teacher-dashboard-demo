## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **WebSocket Integration Complexity**: Allocate extra time for real-time features
- **Cross-browser Compatibility**: Test early and often across browsers
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Focus on mobile-first design approach

### Timeline Risks
- **Scope Creep**: Stick to MVP features only
- **Integration Issues**: Plan integration testing early
- **Performance Issues**: Monitor performance throughout development

## Success Criteria

- [ ] QR code system works reliably across mobile devices
- [ ] Real-time updates function without page refresh
- [ ] All core features implemented and tested
- [ ] Responsive design works on desktop and mobile
- [ ] Application is ready for production deployment
