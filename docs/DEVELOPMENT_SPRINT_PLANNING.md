# ClassSwift Teacher Dashboard - Development Sprint Planning

## Project Timeline

**Development Period**: June 20, 2025 - June 23, 2025 (4 days)  
**Sprint Duration**: 1-day sprints for rapid development  
**Team**: Individual developer

## Current Status (Updated: June 23, 2025)

**Overall Progress**: Significantly Ahead of Schedule - Sprints 1, 2, and 3 fully completed, Sprint 4 nearly complete

**Major Achievements:**
- âœ… Full Docker Compose development environment (frontend, backend, database, cache)
- âœ… Complete dual-modal UI system (left QR modal + right student management modal)
- âœ… Real-time WebSocket integration with seat animations and class updates
- âœ… Full-stack Go backend with PostgreSQL database and comprehensive API endpoints
- âœ… Mock QR code simulation system for demo purposes
- âœ… Production-ready configuration with environment-based feature toggling
- âœ… Centralized configuration system and optimized build pipeline
- âœ… Comprehensive testing infrastructure and deployment preparation

**Next Priority**: Final testing and project delivery

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **WebSocket Integration Complexity**: Allocate extra time for real-time features
- **Cross-browser Compatibility**: Test early and often across browsers
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Focus on mobile-first design approach

### Timeline Risks
- **Scope Creep**: Stick to MVP features only
- **Integration Issues**: Plan integration testing early
- **Performance Issues**: Monitor performance throughout development

## Success Criteria

- [x] QR code system works reliably across mobile devices
- [x] Real-time updates function without page refresh
- [x] All core features implemented and tested
- [x] Responsive design works on desktop and mobile
- [x] Application is ready for production deployment
