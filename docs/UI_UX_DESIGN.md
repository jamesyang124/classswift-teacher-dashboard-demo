# ClassSwift Teacher Dashboard - UI/UX Design

## Overview

This document contains the visual design requirements and user experience guidelines for the ClassSwift Teacher Dashboard application, based on the wireframe design and interface specifications.

## Wireframe Analysis

The interface consists of two primary modal panels operating independently:

### Left Modal - Class Joining Interface
- **Header**: "Join 302 Science" with back navigation ("< Back to Class List") - left-aligned
- **Close Button**: X button in top-right corner
- **Class Information Section**:
  - ID: "X58E9647" with blue copy button (left-aligned in same line with Link)
  - Link: blue copy button only (no URL display) for easy sharing
- **QR Code Display**: Large QR code (360x360px) for mobile scanning with 5% margin from container (no title, maximized to fit both height and width within left modal)
- **Version Information**: "Version 1.1.7" displayed at bottom

### Right Modal - Student Management Interface
- **Header**: Class name "302 Science" with student count indicator "ðŸ‘¥ 16/30"
- **Close Button**: X button in top-right corner
- **Three-dot Menu**: "â‹®" in top-right for additional actions
- **Tab Navigation**: 
  - "Student List" (active/blue)
  - "Group" (inactive/gray)
- **Student Grid Layout**: 5-column responsive grid (seats 01-20 visible)

### Responsive Behavior
- **Desktop**: Dual modal layout as shown
- **Tablet**: Stacked modal approach
- **Mobile**: Single modal with tab switching

### Accessibility Considerations
- **Color Contrast**: Sufficient contrast ratios for all text
- **Touch Targets**: Minimum 44px for mobile interactions
- **Focus States**: Clear keyboard navigation indicators
- **Screen Reader**: Proper ARIA labels for all interactive elements

## User Experience Guidelines

### Seat-based Student Joining Flow
1. Teacher displays left modal with classroom QR code for class identification
2. Students scan seat-specific QR codes at their physical seats
3. Students complete seat-based authentication process  
4. Enrolled students appear immediately in specific seat positions in right modal grid
5. Seat cards transform from gray "Guest" to blue with student name
6. Real-time updates without page refresh

### Point Management Flow
1. Teacher opens right modal
2. Locates student by seat ID in grid layout
3. Uses +/- controls to adjust points (enrolled students only)
4. Minus button becomes disabled when student reaches 0 points
5. Immediate visual feedback with color-coded badges
6. Guest seats remain non-interactive with gray styling

### Navigation Patterns
- **Modal Independence**: Both modals operate simultaneously
- **Clear Exit Points**: X buttons for closing modals
- **Persistent State**: Interface maintains state during session
