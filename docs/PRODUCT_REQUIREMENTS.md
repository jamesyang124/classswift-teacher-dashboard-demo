  - Student Count: Real-time tracking format (current/maximum, max 30 students)
  - Join Link: Backend-generated redirect URL and easily shareable
  - Class Status: Indicates if class is currently accepting students
- **Student Access Methods**:
  - Students scan QR code which redirects to ClassSwift ViewSonic platform

#### 1.2 Class Management System (Right Modal)

##### 1.2.1 Student List Management ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**
- **Grid Layout**: 5-column responsive grid displaying all students with seat-based arrangement
- **Student Cards**: Individual cards showing:
  - **Seat ID** (1 to classroom capacity) as primary identifier
  - Student name (for enrolled students) or "Guest" (for non-enrolled/empty seats)
  - Blue header background for enrolled students
  - Gray header background for guest seats
  - Single score display (0-100 range, non-negative integers)
  - Score management controls (+/- buttons)
- **Multi-Class Enrollment System**:
  - Students can be enrolled in multiple classes simultaneously
  - Each class enrollment has independent seat assignments (randomized 1-30 or null)
  - Normalized database schema with proper foreign key constraints
  - 80% multi-class enrollment rate in demonstration data
- **Real-time Updates**:
  - When students join classes, they appear immediately with smooth animations
  - Student information automatically populates without manual refresh
  - Animation system only triggers for newly seated students
  - WebSocket updates take precedence for immediate visual feedback

##### 1.2.2 Scoring System ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**
- **Score Display**:
  - Single score value: 0-100 range (non-negative integers only)
  - Blue badges for active students, gray for guests
  - Scores reset to 0 when student panel opens
- **Interactive Controls**: 
  - Click-based increment/decrement for each student
  - Minus button disabled when student has 0 score
  - Score changes apply immediately with visual feedback
- **Score Constraints**:
  - Minimum value of 0 enforced
  - Maximum value of 100 enforced
  - Always non-negative integers
- **Session Persistence**: Scores reset when panel opens, maintained during session

##### 1.2.3 Group Management ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**
- **Auto-grouping**: 
  - Automatic creation of 5-student groups from enrolled students only
  - Uneven divisions create additional smaller groups (e.g., 23 students = 4 groups of 5 + 1 group of 3)
  - Guest seats grouped separately after enrolled student groups formed
- **Group Display**: 
  - Visual separation and organization of student groups with rounded border containers
  - Same UI elements as student list (blue cards for enrolled, gray for guests)
  - Score badges visible in group view
- **Group Management**:
  - Sequential group naming (Group 1, Group 2, Group 3, etc.)
  - Client-side group formation logic
  - Single student operations only (no bulk cross-group operations)
  - Local client-side storage only (no database persistence)
- **Guest Integration**: Guest seats can be manually managed as needed

##### 1.2.4 Interface Controls ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**
- **Tab Navigation**: 
  - "Student List": Individual student management view
  - "Group": Group-based view with 5-student clusters
  - Active State: Clear visual indication of selected tab
  - Smooth Transitions: Seamless switching between views
- **Menu System**:
  - Trigger: Three-dot menu button (...) in top-right corner
  - Dropdown Options: 
    - Reset All Seats: Functional - resets all seated students to null
    - Fresh Session: UI display only (non-functional)
  - Positioning: Right-aligned dropdown
  - Interaction: Click outside menu area closes dropdown without action
- **Modal Controls**:
  - Close Functionality: X button to close individual modals only
  - Independent Closing: Modal operations are independent
  - No Navigation: Modal closing does not trigger navigation or page changes
  - Background State: When no modals are open, displays Class List with real database classes
- **Class List Integration**: Background shows real classes from database with proper status indicators
