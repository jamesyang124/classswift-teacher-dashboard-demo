#### 1.2 Class Management System (Right Modal)

##### 1.2.1 Student List Management
- **Grid Layout**: 5-column responsive grid displaying all students with seat-based arrangement
- **Student Cards**: Individual cards showing:
  - **Seat ID** (1 to classroom capacity) as primary identifier
  - Student name (for enrolled students) or "Guest" (for non-enrolled/empty seats)
  - Blue header background for enrolled students
  - Gray header background for guest seats
  - Negative points (red badges)
  - Positive points (green badges)
  - Point management controls (+/- buttons)
- **Seat-based Authentication**:
  - Students scan QR codes at specific physical seats
  - Each seat has unique ID (1 to capacity) and can only be occupied by one student
  - Seat assignments are locked for entire class session
  - One seat per enrolled student policy enforced
- **Real-time Updates**:
  - When students complete seat-based authentication, they appear immediately
  - Student information automatically populates without manual refresh
  - Multiple students can join simultaneously without conflicts
  - Live connection maintains current class state

##### 1.2.2 Point Management System
- **Point Types**:
  - Positive Points: Green badges with + / - controls
  - Negative Points: Red badges with + / - controls
  - Zero Points: Gray badges when student has no points
- **Interactive Controls**: 
  - Click-based increment/decrement for each student
  - Minus button disabled when student has 0 points
  - Point changes apply immediately with visual feedback
- **Point Constraints**:
  - Minimum value of 0 points enforced
  - No upper limit on positive points
  - Color-coded badges for easy visual identification
- **Session Persistence**: Points maintained during class session but reset on browser refresh

##### 1.2.3 Group Management
- **Auto-grouping**: 
  - Automatic creation of 5-student groups from enrolled students only
  - Uneven divisions create additional smaller groups (e.g., 23 students = 4 groups of 5 + 1 group of 3)
  - Guest seats grouped separately after enrolled student groups formed
- **Group Display**: 
  - Visual separation and organization of student groups
  - Same UI elements as student list (blue cards for enrolled, gray for guests)
  - Point badges visible in group view
- **Group Management**:
  - Sequential group naming (Group 1, Group 2, Group 3, etc.)
  - Manual drag-and-drop between groups for adjustments
  - Single student operations only (no bulk cross-group operations)
  - Local client-side storage only (no database persistence)
- **Guest Integration**: Guest seats can be manually dragged to different groups as needed

##### 1.2.4 Interface Controls
- **Tab Navigation**: 
  - "Student List": Individual student management view
  - "Group": Group-based view with 5-student clusters
  - Active State: Clear visual indication of selected tab
  - Smooth Transitions: Seamless switching between views
- **Menu System**:
  - Trigger: Three-dot menu button (...) in top-right corner
  - Dropdown Options: 
    - Reset Points: Clear all student points to zero
    - Fresh Session: Reset entire session (requires students to re-scan seat QR codes then classroom QR code)
  - Positioning: Right-aligned dropdown
  - Interaction: Click outside menu area closes dropdown without action
- **Modal Controls**:
  - Close Functionality: X button to close modals
  - Reset Behavior: Closing resets entire interface
  - Persistence: Interface returns to original state after refresh
