- User interface and experience requirements
- Service requirements and browser compatibility
- Security, quality assurance, and deployment specifications

### [SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md](SYSTEM_ARCHITECTURE.md)
High-level system design covering:
- Component hierarchy and data flow
- Technology stack (React 19.1.0, Vite, Redux Toolkit, Go Gin, WebSockets)
- Database design and API architecture
- Integration patterns and scalability considerations

### [TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md](TECHNICAL_DESIGN.md)
Detailed technical specifications including:
- Complete TypeScript 5.4.5 interfaces and Redux store structure
- Go Gin API endpoints with request/response examples
- Database schema and models
- Styled-components theme configuration
- WebSocket implementation details

## ðŸŽ¨ Design & User Experience

### [UI_UX_DESIGN.md](UI_UX_DESIGN.md)
Visual design specifications based on wireframe analysis:
- Color scheme (Blue #3B82F6, Green #10B981, Red #EF4444)
- Student card layouts and point system design
- Modal specifications and responsive behavior
- Typography and interactive element guidelines

### [WIRE_FRAME.png](WIRE_FRAME.png)
Visual wireframe showing the dual modal interface:
- Left modal: QR code display and class joining information
- Right modal: 5-column student grid with point management
- Student card examples with real data (Philip, Darrell, Cody, etc.)

### [USER_STORIES.md](USER_STORIES.md)
Comprehensive user stories covering:
- Teacher workflows (QR generation, student management, point tracking)
- Student joining processes (QR scanning, alternative methods)
- Guest user limitations and system behaviors
- Real-time synchronization and group formation

## ðŸ§ª Testing & Development

### [TESTING_STRATEGY.md](TESTING_STRATEGY.md)
Testing approach for frontend and backend:
- Frontend: Unit, component, client state management, and UI testing
- Backend: Unit, API, database, and service testing
- Optional approaches: E2E, integration, performance, and cross-browser testing

### [DEVELOPMENT_SPRINT_PLANNING.md](DEVELOPMENT_SPRINT_PLANNING.md)
4-day sprint plan (June 20-23, 2025):
- **Day 1**: Frontend setup + left modal UI + WireMock integration
- **Day 2**: Right modal UI + Go backend setup
- **Day 3**: Backend APIs + frontend-backend integration
- **Day 4**: Testing, polish, and deployment
