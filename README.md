A comprehensive classroom management system that enables teachers to track student engagement, manage groups, and facilitate seamless class joining through QR codes and real-time synchronization.

## Features

### QR Code Class Joining
- **Instant Access**: Students scan QR codes to join classes immediately
- **Multiple Join Methods**: QR code, Class ID, or direct join link
- **Real-time Updates**: Students appear in teacher dashboard without refresh

### Student Management
- **Visual Grid Layout**: 5-column responsive student grid with seat assignments
- **Point System**: Real-time positive/negative point tracking with color-coded badges
- **Guest Support**: Limited participation for non-enrolled students
- **Auto-grouping**: Automatic 5-student group formation for collaborative activities

### Teacher Dashboard
- **Dual Modal Interface**: Independent left (QR joining) and right (student management) modals
- **Live Monitoring**: Real-time student engagement tracking
- **Easy Controls**: One-click point adjustments and copy-to-clipboard functionality
- **Tab Navigation**: Switch between individual student view and group view

## Technology Stack

### Frontend
- **React 18** with TypeScript for type-safe development
- **Redux Toolkit** for predictable state management
- **Styled Components** for component-based styling
- **WebSocket Client** for real-time communication

### Backend
- **Go** with Gin framework for high-performance API
- **WebSocket Server** for real-time synchronization
- **PostgreSQL** database for data persistence
- **RESTful API** with standardized JSON responses

### Development Tools
- **WireMock** for API mocking during frontend development
- **Jest** for frontend testing
- **Go Test** for backend unit testing
- **ESLint & Prettier** for code quality

## Interface Preview

The application features a clean dual-modal interface:

### Left Modal - Class Joining
- Large QR code display for easy scanning
- Class ID (e.g., "X58E9647") with copy button
- Join link sharing functionality
- Class information and navigation

### Right Modal - Student Management
- 5-column grid showing all students (01-20+ seats)
- Color-coded student cards (blue for active, gray for guests)
- Real-time point management with +/- controls
- Tab navigation between Student List and Group views

*See [WIRE_FRAME.png](docs/WIRE_FRAME.png) for complete visual reference.*

## Getting Started
